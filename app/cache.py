# This is a placeholder for the Redis client.
# In a real application, you would use a library like `redis-py` to connect to a Redis server.
# The `init_app` method would typically be used to configure the Redis client with the Flask app's settings.
# For example, you might set the Redis URL from the app's configuration.
